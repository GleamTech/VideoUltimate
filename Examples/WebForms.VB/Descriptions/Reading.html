    This example demonstrates reading a video file via VideoFrameReader class.
</p>
<p>
    First, the total seconds of the video is read to adjust slider range.
    Then whenever the slider is moved, the video is seeked to the specified second
    and a Bitmap instance is acquired via VideoFrameReader.GetFrame method.
    Finally this Bitmap is downloaded and displayed via a simple &lt;img&gt; tag.
    If reading the frame at the specified second fails, a custom error image is downloaded.
